# Arch-Linux-System
My personal configuration files for my Arch Linux System

This is mostly just intended for when I make a new archlinux machine so I can clone the contents of this directory but if you are interested feel free to look around. 
I'm relatively new to linux so don't judge my configurations too much :)

Anyway that's all
