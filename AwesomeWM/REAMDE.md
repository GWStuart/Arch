# Awesome Window Manager
Here are the dotfiles for my awesomewm config. 
Note that my Awesome setup was far from complete as I soon moved from Awesome to Hyprland.

Anyway the files are here anyway but I wouldn't recommend anyone actually use them

To be honest looking at it now this configuration is in a really bad state. Would recommend just restarting from scratch
